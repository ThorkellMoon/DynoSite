Thanks to Mr Werner Drewes, the following publication has been added to the [bibliography][3]:

> _Prähistorische Höhlenmalerei, Aufsätze, Briefe_ \(Köln/Saignelégier: Bruckner & Thünker Verlag, 1993\). Edited by Werner E. Drewes.

The book contains the original German typescript of _Prehistoric Cave Paintings_ together with a selection of letters of Raphael from 1943-52 concerning the genesis of the work and addressed to Claude Schaefer, Emmy Jülich and Alis Guggenheim. It also includes an essay by Mr Drewes titled ‘Raphaels Hand-Annäherungen’.

### 25-06-2018

Mr Yves Brocard kindly pointed us to a digitised address book of Pablo Picasso containing Max Raphael’s 1911/12 address in Paris: 11 Place du Panthéon. The address book can be consulted online here:

> [_Carnet d'adresses de Pablo Picasso_][4]

(There’s some discussion about the exact number: the entry from the notebook could also be read as 17. However, a 1912 open letter by Raphael (written under the pseudonym M.R. Schönlank) titled [_Lieber Herr Pechstein!_][5] is headed with the address ‘Paris, Place du Panthéon 11’.)
